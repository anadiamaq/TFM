Impact of Lifestyle and Genetic Factors on Male Infertility: An Advanced Analysis with Machine Learning and RNAseq

Machine learning models that incorporate lifestyle factors could provide a more accurate prediction of male infertility. The inclusion of covariates in gene expression analysis allows the identification of specific genetic pathways related to infertility, although it may reduce the likelihood of detecting some fertility-related genes, as observed in this study.
